# Rogue Warlock
Rogue Warlock is an isometric roguelite action role-playing game (ARPG) created over a 10 week span for the CPSC 362 Foundations of Software Engineering course at California State University Fullerton by Liam Dwane, Vincent Diep, Preshus Dizon, and Wuxing Zhang. The game is heavily inspired by other isometric roguelites like Supergiant’s *Hades* and Passtech Games’ *Curse of the Dead Gods*, as well as other games in the ARPG genre like Grinding Gear Games’ *Path of Exile*. Currently, the game consists of a starting room, followed by 3 pseudo-randomly generated individual room encounters, followed by a boss encounter to end the game. The game is still in development, so it may be subject to bugs or major updates.
